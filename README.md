It is a tool which reads basic information from an image file, such as file name, image size (in pixels), resolution (dot/inch), color depth,
compression (for those file types in which it can be set).

## Usage
User can specify exact colors using input fields, select colors from the palette, smoothly change colors using sliders. If any component of color is changed, all other representations of that
color in the other two color models are recalculated automatically.
